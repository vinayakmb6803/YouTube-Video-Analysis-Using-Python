# YouTube-Video-Analysis-Using-Python

Project Name: YouTube Video Analysis
This project involves analyzing a large dataset of YouTube videos and their associated metadata, including video titles, channel names, views, likes, dislikes, comment counts, and more. The main objectives of the project are:
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** The project starts by importing and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and exploring the data to gain insights into its structure and content.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Using the TextBlob library, the project performs sentiment analysis on the comments associated with each video to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral sentiment) of the comments.
3. **Wordcloud Analysis:** The project creates wordclouds to visualize the most commonly used words in the comments, providing insights into the topics and sentiments expressed by viewers.
4. **Emoji Analysis:** The project explores the use of emojis in the comments, identifying the most commonly used emojis and their associated frequencies.
5. **Category Analysis:** By mapping the category IDs to their corresponding category names, the project analyzes the likes, dislikes, and comment counts across different video categories to determine the most engaging categories.
6. **Channel Analysis:** The project identifies the channels with the largest number of trending videos, providing insights into the most popular content creators on YouTube.
7. **Punctuation Analysis:** The project explores the relationship between the use of punctuation in video titles and the engagement metrics such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
8. **Data Export:** Finally, the project exports the cleaned and analyzed data into various formats (CSV, JSON, SQLite database) for further analysis or integration with other applications.
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of YouTube video data, offering valuable insights into user engagement, content trends, and the factors that contribute to a video's success on the platform.
